# BLINKS

  This project provides an alternate way for physically incapable people to communicate with the world without use of any special language, so that it makes them feel a bit more     confident while making a conversation. It is basically for people suffering from locked-in syndrome, motor neuron disease and ALS.

   It detects the opening and closing of eyelids of the patient using face recognition with the help of python and open CV. When only right eye would be closed it would be            detected as dot and if only left eye is closed it would be detected as dash. Using this combination of dot and dash with the help of Morse code we would inbuilt some set of        commands like “a” for FOOD, “i” for Water etc .
